# Density-Based-Clustering
DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is an unsupervised clustering algorithm that groups points based on density and identifies outliers as noise. It does not require the number of clusters to be predefined, making it useful for discovering arbitrary-shaped clusters in datasets.
Steps of the DBSCAN Algorithm

Step 1: Compute the Dissimilarity Matrix   

Step 2: Define Parameters (eps and minPts)

Step 3: Identify Core Points

Step 4: Form Clusters

Step 5: Identify Noise Points.

Key Applications of DBSCAN

1)Geospatial Data Analysis (GIS & Earth Science)

2)Anomaly Detection (Fraud & Intrusion Detection)

3)Customer Segmentation in Business & Marketing

4)Image Processing & Pattern Recognition
